This code comes from [a sample app published by the Android Hardware-backed
Keystore Team Lead/Manager](https://github.com/divegeek/AttestationExample) but
is also present [in the Compatibility Test
Suite](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/android-8.1.0_r4/tests/tests/keystore/src/android/keystore/cts).
It would make sense to keep it in sync with the CTS as a canonical upstream.

The code is Apache2 licensed like most Android code.
